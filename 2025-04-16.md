⚠️ Challenges Encountered
Virtual Machine Crash

My virtual machine became unstable due to server-side issues.

I had to completely restart the VM and reinstall everything — it was frustrating and time-consuming.

WordPress Site Lost

Lost all initial WordPress setup and had to start over from scratch.

This caused significant delays and required complete reinstallation and reconfiguration.

Database Connection Error

Encountered: Error Establishing a Database Connection.

Resolved by correcting database credentials in wp-config.php.

Server Instability & SSH Issues

Repeatedly had to recreate the virtual machine.

Reset SSH keys multiple times.

Every time I edited the WordPress site, I encountered database errors.

Error Message:
Error establishing a database connection
This either means that the username and password information in your wp-config.php file is incorrect or that contact with the database server at localhost could not be established.

Are you sure you have the correct username and password?

Are you sure you have typed the correct hostname?

Are you sure the database server is running?

✅ Next Steps
Reinstall SEO plugins like Yoast SEO to enhance search visibility.

Set up plugins for contact forms and event calendars.

💭 Brief Reflection
This week’s assignment was more difficult than expected due to severe server instability. My virtual machine became unusable, forcing me to restart the setup process from scratch. Losing all progress was incredibly frustrating and the biggest challenge I’ve faced in this course so far.

Despite the setbacks, once WordPress was back up and running, I was surprised at how efficiently a basic site could be built with themes and plugins. Using Astra, I quickly created a clean and functional design for the C. Charles Library.

This experience emphasized the importance of backups and server maintenance—especially relevant to real-world library systems where uptime and data preservation are critical. It was a real test of patience, but a great reminder that adaptability is key when working with technology.
