Searching with grep

As a systems librarian, you might deal with large amounts of text-based data: logs from library systems, metadata files, MARC records, exported citation data, and configuration files for tools that you manage. Searching these efficiently is crucial when troubleshooting issues, extracting insights, or automating repetitive tasks. Graphical interface-based applications exist for some of these tasks, but they can be slow, inflexible, or unavailable when working on a remote server. Fortunately we have grep, which is a command-line tool that allows for fast and precise searching. Using grep, we can accomplish all of the above.

There are other powerful utilities and programs to process, manipulate, and analyze text files (e.g., awk, sed, and more). However, in this section, we will focus on the grep utility, which offers advanced methods for searching the contents of text files. Specifically, we'll work through an introduction of grep using a small data file that will help us understand how grep works. Then we will use grep to analyze bibliographic data downloaded as a .bib file from Scopus. This will demonstrate how grep can help you filter specific information from a structured datasetâ€”an approach that can also be applied to processing catalog records, debugging system errors, or analyzing usage logs (e.g., see Arneson, 2017).

grep

The grep command is one of my most often used commands. The purpose of grep is to "print lines that match patterns" (see man grep). In other words, it searches text, and it's super powerful.

grep works line by line. So when we use it to search a file for a string of text, it will return the whole line that matches the string. This line by line idea is part of the history of Unix-like operating systems, and it's important to remember that most utilities and programs that we use on the commandline are line oriented.

"A string is any series of characters that are interpreted literally by a script. For example, 'hello world' and 'LKJH019283' are both examples of strings" (Computer Hope). More generally, it's a type of data structure.

To visualize how grep works, let's consider a file called operating-systems.csv with content as seen below. It's helps to learn something like grep when working with easy, clear examples.

OS, License, Year
Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Linux, GPL, 1991
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
Android, Apache, 2008
We can use grep to search for anything in that file. Let's start with a search for the string Chrome. Notice that even though the string Chrome only appears once, and in one part of a line, grep returns the entire line.

Command:

grep "Chrome" operating-systems.csv
Output:

Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
Case Matching

Be aware that, by default, grep is case-sensitive, which means a search for the string chrome, with a lower case c, returns no results. However, many Linux command line utilities can have their functionality extended through command line options. grep has an -i option that can be used to to ignore the case of the search string. You can learn about grep's other command line options in its man page: man grep. In the following examples, grep returns nothing in the first search since we do not capitalize the string chrome. However, adding the -i option results in success since grep is instructed to ignore case:

Command:

grep "chrome" operating-systems.csv
Output:

None.

Command:

grep -i "chrome" operating-systems.csv
Output:

Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
Invert Matching

grep can do inverse searching. That is, we can search for lines that do not match our string using the -v option. Options can often be combined for additional functionality. We can combine -v to inverse search with -i to ignore the case. In the following example, we search for all lines that do not contain the string chrome:

Command:

grep -vi "chrome" operating-systems.csv
Output:

FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Linux, GPL, 1991
iOS, Proprietary, 2007
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
Android, Apache, 2008
Regular Expressions

Sometimes data files, like spreadsheets, contain header columns in the first row. We can use grep to remove the first line of a file by inverting our search and selecting all lines not matching "OS" at the start of a line. Here the carat key ^ is a regex indicating the start of a line. Again, this grep command returns all lines that do not match the string os at the start of a line, ignoring case:

Command:

grep -vi "^os" operating-systems.csv
Output:

Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Linux, GPL, 1991
iOS, Proprietary, 2007
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
Android, Apache, 2008
Alternatively, since we know that the string Year comes at the end of the first line, we can use grep to invert search for that. Here the dollar sign key $ is a regex indicating the end of a line. Like above, this grep command returns all lines that do not match the string year at the end of a line, ignoring case. The result, in this specific instance, is exactly the same as the last command, indicating that there are sometimes many ways to achieve the same outcome with various commands:

Command:

grep -vi "year$" operating-systems.csv
Output:

Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Linux, GPL, 1991
iOS, Proprietary, 2007
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
Android, Apache, 2008
The man grep page lists other options, but a couple of other good ones include:

Count Matches

If we're looking for patterns in a data file, we may also be interested in their frequency. Fortunately, we can get a count of the matching lines with the -c option.

In the next example, I get a total count of lines that contain the word Proprietary:

grep -ic "proprietary" operating-systems.csv
More broadly, we can get a total count of rows in our file after excluding the header. In other words, we can get the total number of data rows or records:

grep -vic "year$" operating-systems.csv
Alternate Matching

We can do a sort of Boolean OR search by using the vertical bar |, also called the infix operator. This is called an alternate expression. That is, using alternate matching, we can search for at least one string among multiple options.

Here is an example where only one string returns a true value since the file contains bsd but not atari:

Command:

grep -Ei "(bsd|atari)" operating-systems.csv
Output:

FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Here's an example where both strings evaluate to true:

Command:

grep -Ei "(bsd|gpl)" operating-systems.csv
Output:

FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Linux, GPL, 1991
You can use more than two strings:

grep -Ei "(bsd|gpl|apache)" operating-systems.csv
Whole Word Matching

By default, grep will return results where the string appears within a larger word, like OS in macOS.

Command:

grep -i "os" operating-systems.csv
Output:

OS, License, Year
Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
iOS, Proprietary, 2007
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
However, we might want to limit results so that we only return results where OS is a complete word. To do that, we can surround the string with special characters:

Command:

grep -i "\<os\>" operating-systems.csv
Output:

OS, License, Year
Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
Sometimes I find it hard to remember the backslash and angle bracket combinations because they're too much alike HTML syntax but not exactly like HTML syntax. Fortunately, grep has a -w option to match whole words. This functions as another way of searching for whole words:

Command:

grep -wi "os" operating-systems.csv
Output:

OS, License, Year
Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
Context Matches

Sometimes we want the context for a result; that is, we might want to print lines that surround our matches. For example, to print the matching line plus the two lines after the matching line using the -A NUM option, where NUM equals the number of lines to return after the matching line:

Command:

grep -i "linux" -A2 operating-systems.csv
Output:

Linux, GPL, 1991
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
Or, print the matching line plus the two lines before the matching line using the -B NUM option:

Command

grep -i "linux" -B2 operating-systems.csv
Output:

Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Linux, GPL, 1991
We can combine many of the variations. Here I search for the whole word BSD, case insensitive, and print the line before and the line after the match:

Command:

grep -iw -C1 "bsd" operating-systems.csv
Output:

Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Linux, GPL, 1991
Halt Matching

We can use another option to stop returning results after some number of hits. Here I use grep to return a search for the string "proprietary" and stop after the first hit:

Command:

grep -i -m1 "proprietary" operating-systems.csv
Output:

Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
Returning Line Numbers

We can add the -n option to instruct grep to tell us the line number for each hit. Below we see that the string "proprietary" is found on lines 2, 5, and 6.

Command:

grep -in "proprietary" operating-systems.csv
Output:

2:Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
5:macOS, Proprietary, 2001
6:Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
Character Class Matching

We can use grep to search for patterns in strings instead of literal words. Here we use what's called character classes and repetition to search for five letter words that contain any English character a through z:

Command:

grep -Eiw "[a-z]{5}" operating-systems.csv
Output:

Linux, GPL, 1991
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
Or four letter numbers, which highlights the years:

Command:

grep -Eiw "[0-9]{4}" operating-systems.csv
Output:

Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Linux, GPL, 1991
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
Android, Apache, 2008
grep can also search for words that begin with some letter and end with some letter and with a specified number of letters between. Here we search for words that start with m, end with s, and have three letters in the middle:

Command:

grep -Eiw "m.{3}s" operating-systems.csv
Output:

macOS, Proprietary, 2001



##Managing Software

Introduction

ManyLinux distributions use a package manager to handle the installation, upgrades, and uninstalls of the software on a system. The Ubuntu distribution uses a package manager called dpkg and a front-end called apt (advanced package tool). We will use apt to install, update, and remove software from our servers.

sudo

To use the package manager, we will need the sudo command. The sudo command allows us to execute a command as another user (see man sudo). By default, the sudo command executes a command as the superuser (see man 8 sudo).

The name of the superuser account is root. Th root user can perform administrative tasks that regular users cannot. For security purposes, regular accounts may not add, remove, or update software on a system, nor may they modify most files or directories outside their home directories. Using sudo allows regular users who have administrative privileges to perform maintenance tasks on our systems by using executing commands as the root user. Some consider this safer than logging in as the root user.

Not all regular users can use the sudo command. On regular Ubuntu distributions, users must belong to the sudo group in order to run the sudo command. The groups command will return a list of groups that your account belongs to. On the Ubuntu version used by the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), your user should belong in the google-sudoers group. The difference between the sudo group on regular Ubuntu distributions and the google-sudoers GCP version is that regular users in the google-sudoers group are not prompted for their password.

Down the line, we will use the sudo command to modify files, create directories, and perform other maintenance tasks needed to install and manage software. In this lesson, we will use sudo along with the apt commands to update our systems and install software.

sudo syntax

The sudo command is simple to use. When necessary, we use sudo by pre-pending it to the regular commands that we have already learned. In our home directories, for example, we don't need to use sudo to create a new directory with the mkdir command. Instead we type something like mkdir data to create a new directory/folder called data. But our regular user doesn't own the files or directories outside our home directory. For example, when we downloaded my bash scripts to the /usr/local/bin directory, we used sudo since don't own that directory. If I want to create a data directory in /usr/local/bin, then I have to use sudo at the beginning of my command:

cd /usr/local/bin
sudo mkdir data
Or, without changing to that directory, I can just specify the full path:

sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin/data
Or if I want to create a file in some other directory outside my home directory, then I have to use sudo there, too:

cd /srv
sudo touch data.csv
Or, without changing to that directory, I can specify the full path:

sudo touch /srv/data.csv
apt

We will use sudo in the above ways soon enough, but for now, we will use sudo to install, update, and uninstall software on our systems.

Next I'll demonstrate the apt commands that we'll need.

sudo apt update

Your system keeps a record of what software is installed on your system and their version numbers. The sudo apt update command updates that list and compares the update to what's installed. That is, if you have a piece of software called acme1.1 on your system, and acme1.2 is available, then running sudo apt update will let you know that you can upgrade to acme1.2. It's good practice to run sudo apt update before installing or upgrading your system. This lets your system upgrade to the most recent version of what you want to install.

In short, the command to download new package information is:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

Once the list of packages have been updated, you can upgrade with the sudo apt upgrade command if there are any upgrades. When you run this command, and if there are any upgrades, you will be prompted to proceed. You can press Y to proceed, or N to cancel.

This command is simply:

sudo apt upgrade
apt search

If you want to install a piece of software, then you have to install it using its package name. Sometimes that means we have to search for the name of the package. This apt command does not require the use of sudo. sudo is not required because apt search does not modify the system. It simply helps you search for a package name.

For example, the man pages provide helpful documentation about how to use the commands on our systems, but the man pages can also be dense and not straightforward.

Fortunately, there's an application called tldr. This is a community-driven application that provides simple help pages and examples of how to use some of the most commonly used commands.

To search for the tldr package, we execute the following command:

apt search tldr
This returns a list of results that match the search query. One of those results is the tldr package, which is simply named tldr. Not all packages are simply named, which is why we need to search for the specific name.

Note that sometimes when we search for a package, the list of results is quite long. In those cases, pipe the above command through the less pager to page through the results: apt search <packagename> | less

apt show

If we want more specific information about a package, we can use the apt show command along with the package name. Therefore, to get more information about the tldr application, we execute the following command:

apt show tldr
This will return a fuller description of the package (usually), as well as the URL to the application's website, plus other details. We do not need to use sudo because we are not modifying the system. We are only retrieving information.

sudo apt install

To install the tldr application, we use the sudo apt install command along with the package name. We want to make sure that the name of the package is exactly what was returned from the apt search command. In the tldr case, it's pretty straightforward. To install:

sudo apt install tldr
sudo apt remove

In order to remove a package, we use the sudo apt remove command. I like to add the --purge option because this also removes system configuration files that I probably do not need. That is, some applications install configuration files (configs) in the /etc directory. Adding --purge will remove those configs.

To remove a package and its system configuration files (if any), we run the command with the package name:

sudo apt --purge remove tldr
Some configs are stored in your home directory. Generally only end user applications install configs in our home directories. The --purge option will not remove those configs; instead, we have to remove them manually if we want.

sudo apt autoremove

One of the great things about dpkg and apt is that it installs and handles software dependencies really well. Few computer applications are self-contained, and they often require other software to operate. These other software are called dependencies. When we uninstall (or remove) applications, the package manager does not auto uninstall those dependencies that were installed with it. We use the autoremove command to uninstall those, which helps keep our systems clean:

sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean

When we install packages, some files are installed with them. The sudo apt clean removes those extra files and frees up disk space. It's a simple command:

sudo apt clean
The dpkg Command

If you use Windows, then you are likely familiar with downloading and installing .exe files. On macOS, the equivalent are .dmg files. The Ubuntu distribution has an equivalent file. These are .deb files. These files can be installed using the dpkg command:

sudo dpkg -i <file_name.deb>`
Like with exe or dmg files, you want to be careful installing deb files you find on the web. Unlike software managed by the apt system, these files are not monitored and can contain malicious code.

You can generally use apt to remove applications installed with dpkg. Or, you can uninstall an application installed with dpkg with dpkg:

sudo dpkg --purge <application_name>
In most cases, stick with apt.

Conclusion

The apt command makes it quite easy to manage software on our systems. We will use this command to install more complicated software later. Here's a list of commands we covered:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
apt search
apt show
sudo apt install
sudo apt --purge remove
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean
To locate and install software

sudo apt update
apt search <package_name>
apt show <package_name>
sudo apt install <package_name>
To remove software and purge related files

sudo apt --purge remove <package_name>
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean
To keep system up to date

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean
