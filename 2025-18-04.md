Documentation of the OPAC and Cataloging Module
Step-by-Step Setup
Establishing Database Connection

The system connects to a MySQL database using PHP’s mysqli_connect() function.

Configuration settings (host, username, password, and database name) are defined in a separate file (config.php) to keep them centralized and secure.

Structure of the Cataloging Module

The cataloging module includes a form (cataloging.php) for adding bibliographic records such as title, author, publication year, ISBN, and subject.

When the form is submitted, PHP captures the inputs and stores them in the database using a prepared INSERT SQL statement.

Search and Retrieval Functions in the OPAC

The OPAC (opac.php) allows users to search records by keyword.

The PHP script constructs a SELECT query using LIKE operators to search multiple fields such as title, author, and subject.

Results are returned and displayed in a basic table format.

Steps Toward a Real-World System

Implement advanced search filters (e.g., by material type, publication date).

Add user roles and login authentication for security.

Include options for editing or deleting records.

Implement pagination for search results.

Add MARC21 support for more complex metadata.

Configuration Steps

Create and configure the MySQL database using schema.sql.

Ensure Apache, PHP, and MySQL are installed (e.g., using XAMPP or MAMP).

Place PHP files in the server root (e.g., htdocs) and verify connections.

Set permissions to allow write access where necessary.

Key Details
Use of prepared statements prevents SQL injection.

Fields like ISBN are stored as strings to preserve leading zeros.

Proper input validation (e.g., numeric-only checks for year) ensures clean data.

Character encoding (UTF-8) is enforced to prevent issues with special characters.

Using Documentation
PHP and MySQL documentation was consulted, especially for:

mysqli functions and prepared statements.

Error handling with mysqli_error() and mysqli_stmt_error().

Stack Overflow and W3Schools were used to clarify input sanitization and form validation practices.

A gap in the original code was the absence of prepared statements, which I implemented after researching PHP’s security best practices.
