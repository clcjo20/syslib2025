# Journal Entry week 8

##Installing and Configuring MySQL

### Install and Set Up MySQL

n this section, we'll learn how to install, setup, secure, and configure the MySQL relational database so that it works with the Apache web server and the PHP programming language.

First, as normal, we make run the following commands to ensure our machines are fully updated:


sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean

Note that sometimes you will have to reboot your machine, mostly when you get a Linux kernel update. To do so, run sudo reboot now. This command will disconnect you from your machine. Wait a minute or two, and then reconnect.

Then we install the MySQL Community Server package. The MySQL Community Server package is a metapackage that installs the latest, most secure version of MySQL, regardless of the software's version number, as well as its dependencies.

sudo apt install mysql-server
The above install should be fine for us, but note that in some cases you first may want to specifically confirm which versions are available via the apt command since some software (e.g., WordPress) may require specific versions or above. You can check that with the following:

apt policy mysql-server
After installing, you can confirm the version number with the following command to ensure you know which version you are using:

mysql --version
The install process should start and enable the database server, but we can check if it's running and enabled using the systemctl command. Note that you are looking for the lines beginning with Loaded and Active.

systemctl status mysql 
Next we need to run a post installation script called mysql_secure_installation. The script performs some security checks and creates a secure, baseline configuration of MySQL. To do that, run the following command:

sudo mysql_secure_installation
When you run the above script, you'll get a series of prompts to respond to. For most responses, you will want to respond with a Y for yes. We will respond with a Y to the first question on validating passwords, but to keep things simple, select LOW when prompted for the password validation policy. This will enforce a weak password policy for testing, but note that in real-world scenarios, we might want to select a more secure policy. In the output below, I show how to respond to each question:

Validate passwords: Y
Password validation policy: 0 (zero) for LOW
Remove anonymous users: Y
Disallow root login remotely: Y
Remove test database and access to it: Y
Reload privilege tables now: Y
We can login to the database now. In order to do so, we use the following command:

sudo mysql -u root
NOTE: we need to distinguish between the regular user prompt of our Linux accounts and the MySQL prompt below. The default prompt for our user accounts has the following syntax: user_name@computer_name:path$ . In the following, I will indicate we are at the MySQL prompt with the following text: mysql>. Do not type that prompt when you are using MySQL.

When I connect to a MySQL server, I like to list the available databases. To do this, we use the show databases; command. Note that MySQL commands end with a semicolon:

mysql> show databases;
The following databases should be returned:

+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)
To exit the MySQL server prompt and return to the Bash shell, we use the following command:

mysql> \q

####Create and Set Up a Regular User Account

We need to reserve the root MySQL user for special administrative cases and create a regular MySQL user account for regular use cases.

To create a regular MySQL user, we use the MySQL create command. In the command below, I create a new user called opacuser with a complex password. The single quotes are quoting the password and are not the password itself. Thus in the example below, the Xs indicate my password.

First, log back into the MySQL server:

sudo mysql -u root
At the MySQL prompt, create the new user:

mysql> create user 'opacuser'@'localhost' identified by 'Psalms124';
If the prompt returns a Query OK message, then the new user should have been created without any issues.

#**Create a Practice Database**


As the root database user, we create a new database for the user account we just created. We'll call this database opacdb and set the character encoding to UTF-8 to support international characters. Then we run the MySQL show command to view the new database. Next we grant all privileges on the database to the user account opacuser.

mysql> create database opacdb default character set utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
mysql> show databases;
mysql> grant all privileges on opacdb.* to 'opacuser'@'localhost' with grant option;
Other than granting all privileges, we could limit the user to specific privileges, including:

CREATE
DROP
DELETE
INSERT
SELECT
UPDATE
GRANT OPTION
Such privileges may be called operations or functions. They allow MySQL users to use and modify the databases, where appropriate. For example, we may want to limit the opacuser user account to only be able to use SELECT commands. These decisions depend on the purpose of the database and our security risks.

Exit out of the MySQL database as the root MySQL user, and then exit out of the root Linux user account. You should be back to your normal Linux user account:

mysql> \q
Note: relational database keywords are often written in all capital letters: CREATE, DROP, SELECT, etc. As far as I know, this is simply a convention to make the code more readable. However, in most cases I'll write the keywords in lower case letters. This is simply because, by convention, I'm lazy.

# Logging in as Regular User and Creating Tables

We can now start doing MySQL work. Note that when we login to the MySQL server, we leave the bash shell and enter the MySQL command line client. By default, the prompt for the client is bare-bones. We can make it more informative, though. To do so, open your .bashrc file:

nano .bashrc
Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following:

export MYSQL_PS1="[\d]> "
Then save and exit and source the file:

source ~/.bashrc
As a reminder, we've created a new MySQL user named opacuser and a new database for opacuser that is called opacdb. When we run the show databases command as the opacuser user, we should see the opacdb database. Note below that I use the -p option when logging back into MySQL as the opacuser. This instructs MySQL to request the password for this user, it is required.

mysql -u opacuser -p
From the MySQL prompt, list the available databases and use the use command to switch to the new opacdb database:

mysql> show databases;
mysql> use opacdb;
A database is not worth much without data. In the following code, I create and define a new table for our opacdb database. The table will be called books that will contain data describing, er, some books. We will keep this table very simple and use only four fields: id, author, title, and copyright. The id field will function as a primary key (second to last line in the command below). This key is used as a unique identifier for a record in the field. When we create this key as a field called id, we state that it should be an integer id (or whole number), that it should only be a positive number unsigned, that it should not be empty not null, and that with each record, it should increment by a single integer auto_increment. When we create the author and title fields, we say that these fields can have a maximum length of 150 characters and should not be empty. When we create the copyright field, we limit it to the year data type, which means it has to adhere to a specific syntax YYYY, and should not be empty.

mysql> create table books (
        id int unsigned not null auto_increment,
        author varchar(150) not null,
        title varchar(150) not null,
        copyright year(4) not null,
        primary key (ID)
);
Note: A relational database contains tables. If you are unfamiliar with this, you can think of a database as an overall Excel spreadsheet file and tables as specific sheets in the Excel file. There is quite a bit that goes into creating proper tables in database because the composition dictates how well data is described and how tables connect and interact with (or relate to) each other. However, we are going to keep things rather simple in this exercise.

You can confirm that the table was created by running the following two commands. The MySQL show command lists the tables in a database and the describe command describes a table's structure.

mysql> show tables;
mysql> describe books;
Congratulations! Now create some records for that table.

##Adding records into the table

We can populate our opacdb database with some data. (I simply picked the first book listed from the NYTimes best lists of books for the years 2019-2022.) We'll use the MySQL insert command to add our records into our books table. We need to specify three fields when entering data: author, title, and copyright. The copyright field is a date field, and it should conform to the YYYY syntax. We do not need to specify data for the id field because that will be created and will increment automatically.

mysql> insert into books (author, title, copyright) values
('Jennifer Egan', 'The Candy House', '2022'),
('Imbolo Mbue', 'How Beautiful We Were', '2021'),
('Lydia Millet', 'A Children\'s Bible', '2020'),
('Julia Phillips', 'Disappearing Earth', '2019');
Now we can view all the records that we just created with the MySQL select command:

mysql> select * from books;
Success! Now let's test our table.

###Testing Commands

We will complete the following tasks to refresh our MySQL knowledge or begin to learn how it works. We will:

retrieve records or parts of records,
delete a record,
alter the table structure so that it will hold more data, and
add a record
Note: each MySQL command ends with a semi-colon. Some of the following MySQL commands are single-line, but others are multi-line. Regardless if a MySQL command is one-line or multi-line, it doesn't end until it ends with a semi-colon.

Please run the following commands, one at a time:

mysql> select author from books;
mysql> select copyright from books;
mysql> select author, title from books;
mysql> select author from books where author like '%millet%';
mysql> select title from books where author like '%mbue%';
mysql> select author, title from books where title not like '%e';
mysql> select * from books;
mysql> alter table books add publisher varchar(75) after title;
mysql> describe books;
mysql> update books set publisher='Simon \& Schuster' where id='1';
mysql> update books set publisher='Penguin Random House' where id='2';
mysql> update books set publisher='W. W. Norton \& Company' where id='3';
mysql> update books set publisher='Knopf' where id='4';
mysql> select * from books;
mysql> delete from books where author='Julia Phillips';
mysql> insert into books
       (author, title, publisher, copyright) values
       ('Emma Donoghue', 'Room', 'Little, Brown \& Company', '2010'),
       ('Zadie Smith', 'White Teeth', 'Hamish Hamilton', '2000');
mysql> select * from books;
mysql> select author, publisher from books where copyright < '2011';
mysql> select author from books order by copyright;
mysql> \q


###Install PHP and MySQL Support

The next goal is to complete the connection between PHP and MySQL so that we can use both for our websites.

First install PHP support for MySQL. We're installing some modules alongside the basic support. These may or may not be needed, but I'm installing them to demonstrate some basics.

sudo apt install php-mysql php-mysqli
And then restart Apache and MySQL:

sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart mysql


###Create PHP Scripts

In order for PHP to connect to MySQL, it needs to authenticate itself. To do that, we will create a login.php file in in our document root's parent directory: /var/www. We also need to change the group ownership of the file and its permissions (see note below). This will allow the file to be read by the Apache web server but not by the world. This prevents the password information from being accessible to web users.

cd /var/www
sudo touch login.php
sudo chmod 640 login.php
sudo chown :www-data login.php
ls -l login.php
sudo nano login.php
A Short Aside on File Ownership and Permissions

We haven't covered in detail the concept of file ownership and permissions. In short, files and directories are owned by users and by user groups. When we run a command like ls -l, the output will show the file owner and the group owner: In the output below, the user root is the file owner and the group www-data is the group owner of the file login.php.

-rw-r----- 1 root www-data    0 Feb 14 02:44 login.php
We change the file permissions with the chmod command. We change the file ownership with the chown command. In the above code snippet, the chmod 640 login.php command changes the file permissions to:

user owner: read, write
group owner: read only
other/world: no permissions
For an in-depth tutorial, see Linux Systems Administrations, Chapter 3.3 File Permissions and Ownership

When we created the file using the sudo touch login.php command, the use of sudo creates the file with root as the owner. The chown :www-data login.php command changes the group ownership to www-data. The www:data user is the Apache user.

Many services, like Apache, have corresponding users on the system. Files placed in our document root /var/www/html will be served on the web. Therefore, those files must have read access for other/world. But we don't want the login.php file to be accessible to the world since it contains login information for our MySQL user. Thus, in addition to modifying file ownership and permissions, we also place it in the parent directory /var/www.

In the file, add the following credentials. If for some reason you used a different database name than opacdb and a different username than opacuser, then you need to substitute your names below. You need to use your own password where I have the Xs:

<?php // login.php
$db_hostname = "localhost";
$db_database = "opacdb";
$db_username = "opacuser";
$db_password = "XXXXXXXXX";
?>
Next we create a new PHP file for our website. This file will display HTML but will primarily be PHP interacting with our opacdb database.

Create a file titled opac.php in /var/www/html.

cd /var/www/html
sudo nano opac.php
Then copy over the following text. I suggest you transcribe it, especially if you're interested in learning a bit of PHP.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>MySQL Server Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>A Basic OPAC</h1>
    <p>We can retrieve all the data from our database and book table using a couple of different queries.</p>

    <?php
    // Load MySQL credentials securely
    require_once '/var/www/login.php';

    // Enable detailed MySQL error reporting
    mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);

    // Establish database connection
    $conn = new mysqli($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password, $db_database);

    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }

    echo "<h2>Query 1: Retrieving Publisher and Author Data</h2>";

    // Query using prepared statement
    $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT publisher, author FROM books");
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();

    while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "<p>Publisher " . htmlspecialchars($row["publisher"]) .
             " published a book by " . htmlspecialchars($row["author"]) . ".</p>";
    }

    $stmt->close();

    echo "<h2>Query 2: Retrieving Author, Title, and Date Published Data</h2>";

    $stmt2 = $conn->prepare("SELECT author, title, copyright FROM books");
    $stmt2->execute();
    $result2 = $stmt2->get_result();

    while ($row = $result2->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "<p>A book by " . htmlspecialchars($row["author"]) .
             " titled <em>" . htmlspecialchars($row["title"]) .
             "</em> was released in " . htmlspecialchars($row["copyright"]) . ".</p>";
    }

    $stmt2->close();
    $conn->close();
    ?>

</body>
</html>

Save the file and exit out of nano or text editor of choice  .

###Test Syntax

After you save the file and exit the text editor, we need to test the PHP syntax. If there are any errors in our PHP, these commands will show the line numbers causing errors or leading up to errors. Nothing will output if all is well with the first command. If all is well with the second command, HTML should be outputted:

sudo php -f /var/www/login.php
sudo php -f /var/www/html/opac.php
Now view the site by opening the public IP address for your server in your browser. If all goes well, you should see the data in your opacdb database and books table rendered in your webpage.

####Conclusion

Congratulations! If you've reached this far, you have successfully created a LAMP stack. In the process, you have learned how to install and set up MySQL, how to create MySQL root and regular user accounts, how to create a test database with play data for practicing, and how to connect this with PHP for display on a webpage.

In regular applications of these technologies, there's a lot more involved, but completing the above process is a great start to learning more.


#Journal entry week 9 Introduction to Relational Databases

In the last section, we installed, configured, and setup a Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) stack. While setting up MySQL, we created a basic opacdb database containing a books table. Then we learned a few queries to get a feel for how querying a relational database, like MySQL, works.

In this section, we are going to spend a bit more time with MySQL simply to acquire a greater understanding of relational databases. The real power of relational databases lies in their ability to manage and retrieve data efficiently. This is accomplished by spreading data across multiple tables in order to limit data duplication and increase efficiency.

We'll create a new database for our opacuser. Unlike the opacdb database, our new database, which we'll call DinnerDB, will contain two tables. This will reduce the amount of data we need to add to our database.

##Create Database

First, we will create a new database. Our opacuser does not have the privileges to create a new database, so we must login as the root MySQL user:

sudo mysql -u root
Once logged in, we create a database called DinnerDB. We could create another user, but for our purposes, we can simply grant opacuser privileges on the new database.

mysql> create database DinnerDB;
mysql> grant all privileges on DinnerDB.* to 'opacuser'@'localhost';
We can now exit the root MySQL user account:

mysql> \q


###Create Tables

Next we login as opacuser:

mysql -u opacuser -p
First, let's check if we can see if the new DinnerDB database is visible to opacuser. If so, we begin using it:

[(none)]> show databases;
[(none)]> use DinnerDB;

####Create Meals Table

We are going to create two tables in DinnerDB. We will call the first table Meals and the second table Ingredients. The second table will list the ingredients and quantities needed to make the meals named in the Meals table.

The following command creates a table called Meals. The table has five values:

meal_id is an integer that serves as the primary key.
meal_name contains a variable-length string up to 100 characters.
cuisine contains a variable-length string up to 50 characters.
cooking_time is an integer that uses a CHECK constraint so that if a user enters a zero or a negative value, MySQL will reject it, or if a user enters no value, it will default to one.
vegetarian contains a BOOLEAN value, which means it must be TRUE or FALSE:
technically, BOOLEAN is synonymous with a data type called TINYINT(1), but BOOLEAN better conveys what we mean.
create table Meals (
    meal_id int auto_increment primary key,
    meal_name varchar(100) not null,
    cuisine varchar(50),
    cooking_time int not null default 1 check (cooking_time > 0),
    vegetarian boolean
);

#####  i learned Create Ingredients table

The following command creates the Ingredients table. The table has four values:

ingredient_id is the primary key.
meal_id is an integer:
the last line in the command declares the meal_id value to be a foreign key that references the meal_id primary key in the Meals table
foreign keys allow for cross-referencing to primary keys.
since we cross-reference meal_id in the Ingredients table to meal_id in the Meals table, we make the Ingredients table a child of the Meals table, which by entailment functions as the parent table to the Ingredients table.
the on delete cascade clause instructs MySQL to delete associated ingredients when deleting a meal in the Meals table.
ingredient_name contains a variable-length string up to 100 characters.
quantity contains a variable-length string up to 50 characters.
create table Ingredients (
    ingredient_id int auto_increment primary key,
    meal_id int,
    ingredient_name varchar(100) not null,
    quantity varchar(50),
    foreign key (meal_id) references Meals(meal_id) on delete cascade
);


# I accomplished how to Insert data

Now that we have created the structure of our two tables, we can begin adding data to them. The first command adds four records to the Meals table:

insert into Meals (meal_name, cuisine, cooking_time, vegetarian) values
    ('Spaghetti Bolognese', 'Italian', 45, FALSE),
    ('Vegetable Stir Fry', 'Chinese', 20, TRUE),
    ('Chicken Curry', 'Indian', 50, FALSE),
    ('Mushroom Risotto', 'Italian', 35, TRUE);
And the second command adds the list of ingredients for the meals we added to the Meals table. The integers we use for meal_id match the values produced in the Meals table, which we can see with the select * from Meals; command. Therefore, 1 refers to Spaghetti Bolognese, 2 refers to Vegetable Stir Fry, and so on.

insert into Ingredients (meal_id, ingredient_name, quantity) values
    (1, 'Spaghetti', '200g'),
    (1, 'Ground Beef', '250g'),
    (1, 'Tomato Sauce', '1 cup'),
    (2, 'Broccoli', '100g'),
    (2, 'Carrots', '50g'),
    (2, 'Soy Sauce', '2T'),
    (3, 'Chicken Breast', '300g'),
    (3, 'Curry Powder', '2T'),
    (3, 'Coconut Milk', '1 cup'),
    (4, 'Arborio Rice', '1 cup'),
    (4, 'Mushrooms', '1 cup'),
    (4, 'Parmesan Cheese', '1/2 cup');
In practice, we might want to create an additional column that would contain units for the quantities (e.g., cups, grams, etc).
This would result in better [database normalization][db_normalization_wiki].

# Ilearned how to Querying Data

Now that we have created our tables and added records to them, we can begin to query them. The next command is a simple SELECT statement that returns the entire contents of the Meals table:

select * from Meals;
We can filter results with the WHERE clause. In this example, we filter results by whether a meal is vegetarian:

select * from Meals where vegetarian = TRUE;
We can sort the results by descending or ascending order. This works for both alphabetic and numeric characters. The following commands sort the Meals by length of cooking time, which is an integer:

select * from Meals order by cooking_time desc; 
select * from Meals order by cooking_time asc; 
In the following command, we select three values:

meal_name from the Meals table and rename the resulting column Meals.
ingredient_name from the Ingredients table and rename the resulting column Ingredients.
quantity from the Ingredients table and rename the resulting column Quantity.
We also use the join action to cross-reference the tables based on the shared meal_id value. Note that I use the table_name.column_name syntax in the query. For example, Meals.meal_name refers to the column meal_name in the Meals table, and so forth. The as in as Meals, as Ingredients, and as Quantity instructs MySQL to rename the columns. This is useful for the presentation of the data:

select Meals.meal_name as Meals,
    Ingredients.ingredient_name as Ingredients,
    Ingredients.quantity as Quantity
    from Meals
    join Ingredients on Meals.meal_id = Ingredients.meal_id;
In the following example, we list the ingredients and their quantities based on the name of a meal. In this case, we are looking to list the ingredients for the Chicken Curry dish:

select ingredient_name as Ingredients,
    quantity as Quantity
    from Ingredients 
    where meal_id = (select meal_id from Meals where meal_name = 'Chicken Curry');
In the following example, we instruct MySQL to provide a count of the Meals by cuisine:

select cuisine, count(*) as meal_count 
    from Meals
    group by cuisine;
And finally, it's been a tough day, and we want to identify Meals that don't take long to cook. The following command returns all Meals where the cooking time is less than or equal to 45 minutes:

select meal_name, cooking_time 
    from Meals 
    where cooking_time <= 45
    order by cooking_time asc;
Once done querying our database, we can logout:

\q

## I learned about databse  Management

When we started this lesson, we logged into MySQL and created a database called DinnerDB. Then we granted opacuser all privileges to this database. There might be times when we want to revoke those privileges. To do so, we first log back in as the root MySQL user:

sudo mysql -u root
Now we can re-review the privileges for opacuser:

mysql> show grants for 'opacuser'@'localhost';
We can take away those privileges with the REVOKE command:

mysql> revoke all privileges on DinnerDB.* from 'opacuser'@'localhost';
To confirm, we can re-run the show grants command.

If we want to track other users in with accounts in the MySQL server, the following command queries the user table in the mysql database and will return all user accounts:

select user, host from mysql.user;
We can also delete the database using the DROP command:

mysql> drop database DinnerDB;
If desired, we can delete user accounts (but don't do this with opacuser). For example, if had a user named sean, then we could use the following command to remove their account:

mysql> drop user 'sean'@'localhost';

** Then we conclucded **

Conclusion

In this introduction, we explored the basics of relational databases using MySQL. We created a structured database (DinnerDB), defined two tables (Meals and Ingredients), inserted data, and performed various queries to retrieve information efficiently.

The key takeaways from this exercise include:

Normalization: Breaking data into multiple tables reduces redundancy and improves consistency.
Relationships: Using foreign keys, we linked meals with their ingredients. This allows for more meaningful data retrieval.
Querying: We practiced SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, ORDER_BY, and GROUP_BY to manipulate and filter data results.
Management: We reviewed how to create a database, grant privileges to the database to a specific user, remove those privileges, and delete the database.
This tutorial is only a start. You should experiment with modifying the data, adding constraints, separating quantities from units, or creating additional tables to further your understanding.

Databases are powerful tools for organizing and retrieving structured information. If you understand SQL and its logic, it will help you in other domains, too! So go play!

And if interested, I encourage you to learn other SQL implementation, like SQLite, which you can download and install on your personal machines fairly easily. SQLite is probably the most popular SQL application, but it uses a slightly different command syntax.
