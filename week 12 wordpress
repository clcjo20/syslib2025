#Objective:
Install and configure a WordPress site that will serve as the central public-facing hub for your library ecosystem.

##Instructions:
Follow the detailed step-by-step instructions and accompanying video walk-through provided below. Your WordPress site should be live, accessible, and configured with basic site information such as title, tagline, and a custom homepage. Document the process on GitHub and make notes of any issues you encountered and how you resolved them. Use clearly structured Markdown for this.

Do not submit screenshots.

###Deliverables:
A working UR for your WordPress installation
A link to your GitHub notes/documentation
A brief write-up (100-200 words) summarizing your experience and any challenges.
Evaluations of written components:
Submissions that demonstrate thoughtfulness, specificity, and depth of reflection are more likely to receive a Complete. Consider questions like:

####Describe a specific problem you encountered and how you addressed it.
Identify one thing that surprised you or was different from a previous assignment.
Reflect on how this component contributes to real-world library operations.

1. Install WordPress
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following ready:

LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) installed on your server.

A database created for your WordPress site (as detailed in previous steps).

The WordPress files downloaded and placed in the correct directory (/var/www/html/wordpress).

# Download WordPress
cd /var/www/html
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

# Extract the files
tar -xvzf latest.tar.gz

# Move WordPress files to the right directory
mv wordpress/* .
rm -rf wordpress
rm -f latest.tar.gz

# Set correct file permissions
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/


2. Configure the Database and wp-config.php

mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
CREATE USER 'wordpress'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpress'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

Edit wp-config.php

sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php

sudo a2ensite wordpress.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2


4. Run the WordPress Installation Wizard
Now, visit your server’s IP address (http://34.56.76.45/wordpress) in a browser.

You will be greeted by the WordPress installation wizard. Choose your language, set your site title, admin username, password, and email.


5. Customize Your WordPress Site
Title and Tagline: Go to Settings > General and make sure your site’s title is set to something like "C. Charles Library" and the tagline to something appropriate, like "Your Local Library Hub."

Homepage Setup: Go to Settings > Reading and set the homepage to display a static page (choose a custom page you create later) or set it to display your latest posts.

Theme: Install a theme that fits your library's brand. I recommend a clean, professional theme, like Astra or OceanWP, available from the WordPress theme repository.


6. Document the Process on GitHub
# C. Charles Library Website Setup

## Installation Process

1. Installed WordPress using LAMP stack on Ubuntu 20.04.
2. Created a database named `wordpress` and user `wordpress` with appropriate privileges.
3. Configured `wp-config.php` with correct database details.
4. Set up Apache VirtualHost to point to the WordPress directory.
5. Followed WordPress installation wizard to complete the setup.

## Customization

1. Set the site title as "C. Charles Library" and tagline as "Your Local Library Hub."
2. Set homepage to static and added initial content.
3. Installed **Astra** theme for a clean and modern layout.
4. Created a custom menu and added essential pages: About, Catalog, Contact.

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Database Connection Error**: Initially had issues with database connection due to incorrect database credentials in `wp-config.php`. Resolved by verifying database name, user, and password.
2. **Theme Customization**: The default theme didn’t match the branding of C. Charles Library, so I installed and customized the **Astra** theme. It required some time to tweak the header and footer settings to match our design.

## Next Steps

- Set up SEO plugins like **Yoast SEO** to improve search visibility.
- Configure additional plugins for contact forms and event listings.

7. Write a Brief Reflection (100-200 words)

Setting up the C. Charles Library website on WordPress was a straightforward process, though a few technical challenges came up. One of the main issues was the "Error Establishing Database Connection" message. This was caused by incorrect credentials in the wp-config.php file, which I resolved by double-checking the database settings in both MySQL and the WordPress config file. Once that was fixed, I was able to run the WordPress installation wizard with no further issues.

One thing that surprised me was how quickly I could set up a functional website with just a few plugins and customizations. I had expected it to take much longer. The ability to create a static homepage and customize the look and feel using a theme like Astra was very efficient. This is incredibly useful in the context of a library website, where ease of access and clean design are essential for user experience.

In a real-world library setting, this would streamline the process of building a functional public-facing site, with resources like book catalogs, event listings, and easy access to contact details.


the things i had trouble with was i had to restart my virtual machine becausee soething was wrong on the server side of things . also i lost my wordpress site and i'm having to start it over from scratch , this made me frustrated.  so this is the biggest trouble ive encountered  .
