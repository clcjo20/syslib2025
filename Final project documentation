Omeka Installation Reflection

Installation Process
Installing Omeka Classic involved a process similar to setting up the foundational layers of an ILS or WordPress site. The steps included:

Prerequisites

Updated system packages
Installed PHP, MySQL, and ImageMagick
Enabled the Apache mod_rewrite module
Installation Steps

Download Omeka Classic
Used wget to download the package from the official site.
Extract Files
Extracted files into /var/www/html/ and renamed the folder to simplify URL paths.
Database Setup
Created a new MySQL database and user specifically for Omeka to keep it isolated from the WordPress database.
Configuration
Edited the db.ini file with the appropriate database credentials.
Permissions
Adjusted file and folder permissions using chown to ensure proper ownership by the web server.
Restart Services
Restarted Apache and MySQL services to apply the changes.
Web Interface Setup
Completed installation via the browser-based setup.
Accessed the admin dashboard and began creating collections and items.
Integration with WordPress
I applied knowledge from my WordPress setup to handle server-side configurations such as file permissions, database credentials, and troubleshooting issues. I also created a custom menu in WordPress linking to the Omeka site, allowing for a seamless user experience across both platforms.

Reflection on the Process
Navigation Integration Challenge

One specific challenge was linking Omeka and WordPress effectively. Initially, I tried embedding a direct link from Omeka back to WordPress, but this caused navigation inconsistencies.

Solution: I reversed the flowâ€”adding a custom menu link in Omeka that directed users to the WordPress homepage instead. This kept WordPress as the central hub and preserved a clean user experience.

Key Reflections
Documentation Gaps:
Omeka lacks beginner-friendly installation guides compared to the wealth of resources available for WordPress.
Real-World Application:
This process reflects the challenges real libraries face in managing multiple digital platforms. Being able to troubleshoot, integrate, and adapt to different tools is essential for running seamless library services and online exhibitions.
