Omeka Installation Reflection
Installation Process
Installing Omeka involved a process similar to setting up the bare bones of an ILS and WordPress. The steps included:

Prerequisites:

Updated system packages

Installed PHP, MySQL, and ImageMagick

Enabled the Apache mod rewrite module

Installation Steps:

Download Omeka Classic:
Use wget to download the package.

Extract Files:
Extract the files into /var/www/html and rename the folder for simplicity.

Database Setup:
Create a new MySQL database and user specifically for Omeka to keep it separate from WordPress.

Configuration:
Edit the db.ini file with your database credentials.

Permissions:
Adjust file permissions using chown.

Restart Services:
Restart Apache and MySQL services to apply the changes.

Web Interface Setup:
Complete the setup via the Omeka web interface at Omeka Public Site, access the admin dashboard, and begin creating collections and items.

I adapted my prior experience from the WordPress installation to confidently manage server-side steps such as configuring permissions, editing database credentials, and troubleshooting potential errors. Finally, linking my WordPress site to Omeka via custom menus provided seamless integration between both platforms.

Reflection on the Process
During the Omeka installation process, one specific challenge was creating a functional link from my WordPress site to the Omeka digital library. Initially, I assumed embedding a direct link from Omeka back to WordPress would be straightforward. However, this approach presented navigation issues. The solution was to reverse the directionâ€”adding a custom menu link in Omeka that directed users to the WordPress site instead. This adjustment not only solved the problem but also maintained a clean user experience by keeping WordPress as the central hub.

Key Reflections:

Documentation Gaps:
I was surprised by the lack of detailed, beginner-friendly documentation for installing Omeka. In comparison, WordPress has extensive guides and community support.

Real-World Application:
This experience mirrors real-world library operations, where administrators manage multiple platforms and digital services. The ability to troubleshoot, integrate systems, and adapt to different software environments is crucial for maintaining seamless access to digital collections and online exhibits in modern libraries.
